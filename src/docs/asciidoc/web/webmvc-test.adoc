This section summarizes the options available in `spring-cn.eleven.test` for Spring MVC applications.

**Servlet API Mocks**

Mock implementations of Servlet API contracts for unit testing controllers, filters, and
other web components. See <<testing.adoc#mock-objects-servlet,Servlet API>> mock objects
for more details.

**TestContext Framework**

Support for loading Spring configuration in JUnit and TestNG tests including efficient
caching of the loaded configuration across cn.eleven.test methods and support for loading a
`WebApplicationContext` with a `MockServletContext`.
See <<testing.adoc#testcontext-framework,TestContext Framework>> for more details.

**Spring MVC Test**

A framework, also known as `MockMvc`, for testing annotated controllers through the
`DispatcherServlet`, i.e. supporting annotations and complete with Spring MVC
infrastructure, but without an HTTP server. See
<<testing.adoc#spring-mvc-cn.eleven.test-framework,Spring MVC Test>> for more details.

**Client-side REST**

`spring-cn.eleven.test` provides a `MockRestServiceServer` that can be used as a mock server for
testing client-side code that internally uses the `RestTemplate`.
See <<testing.adoc#spring-mvc-cn.eleven.test-client,Client REST Tests>> for more details.

**WebTestClient**

`WebTestClient` was built for testing WebFlux applications but it can also be used for
end-to-end integration testing, to any server, over an HTTP connection. It is a
non-blocking, reactive client and well suited for testing asynchronous and streaming
scenarios.
